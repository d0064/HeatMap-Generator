# Heatmap Video Generator

This Python script (`heatmap.py`) allows you to generate a heatmap video from a source video. The heatmap video visualizes the areas of the source video that attract the most attention.

## Required Libraries

Before running the script, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2) library
- NumPy library

You can install the required libraries using pip:

pip install opencv-python numpy

Usage
Follow these steps to generate a heatmap video:

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the project directory in your command line terminal:

cd path/to/heatmap-video-generator
Run the script using the following command:

python heatmap.py
The script will open a file dialog for you to select the source video.

After selecting the source video, the script will process it and generate the heatmap.

The heatmap will be saved as heatmap.avi in the same directory as the script.

Once the script completes, you can find the heatmap video (heatmap.avi) in the same directory as the script.
